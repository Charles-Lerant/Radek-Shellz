# Radek-Shellz
Lazy python reverse shell generator.
This generator works assuming Python is installed on the computer and maybe some other tools and if for some reason you don't want to use a python shell it'll connect back using the shell of your choice if the right tools are installed on your target.
Really this was just a proof of concept to see if I can develop a "malicious" tool using chatGPT the next step is to add the option to output the revershell command in an encypted format locally with a passphrase then the encrypted command can be used on the remote computer and the tool decrypt it to make the connection and hope to bypass AV in this manner
